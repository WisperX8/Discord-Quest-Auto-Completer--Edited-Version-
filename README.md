# Discord Quest Auto-Completer (Edited Version)

**Note**  
This script automatically completes all your accepted quests in Discord.  
This does **not** work for browser-based quests that require you to "play" a game or stream — for those, use the **Discord Desktop app**.  

---

## How to use this script:

1. Accept a quest under **Discover → Quests**.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open DevTools.
3. Go to the **Console** tab.
4. Paste the provided code and press **Enter**.
   - If you're unable to paste into the console, type `allow pasting` and press **Enter** first.
5. The script will automatically process **all pending quests**:
   - Video quests: will auto-complete after simulated progress.
   - Play-on-desktop quests: will spoof the app running in the desktop client.
   - Stream quests: will spoof streaming in a VC (you need at least 1 other person in VC).
6. Wait a bit for each quest to complete.
7. You can now claim your rewards!
8. Track progress via **Console prints** or the progress bars in the Quests tab.

**Disclaimer:**  
- This script is based on the original work by [aamiaa](https://gist.github.com/aamiaa/204cd9d42013ded9faf646fae7f89fbb) and has been edited for personal use and to automatically complete multiple quests in one run.  
- Use at your own risk; may violate Discord's Terms of Service.
